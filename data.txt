Answer for "Three particles A, B and C, each of mass m, are placed in that \
order, in a straight line on a
smooth horizontal table. The particle A is given a velocity u such \
that it collides directly with
the particle B. After colliding with the particle A, the particle 8 \
moves and collides directly with
the particle C. The coefficient of restitution between A and B is e. \
Find the velocity of B after
the first collision.

The coefficient of restitution between B and C is also e. Write down \
the velocity of C after its
collision with B." is x+y
